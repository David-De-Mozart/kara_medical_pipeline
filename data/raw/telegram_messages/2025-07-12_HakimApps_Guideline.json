A total of 3,498 SAH cases were matched with 13,992 controls by age, sex, and follow-up. Statin exposure was assessed prior to SAH, and models adjusted for comorbidities.\n\nResults:\n\u25aa\ufe0fStatin use was reported in 12.2% of cases vs. 12.7% of controls.\n\u25aa\ufe0fStatin use was associated with a 19% lower risk of SAH (adjusted odds ratio: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69\u20130.95).\n\u25aa\ufe0fThe protective effect was stronger in those with hypertension or cerebrovascular disease.\n\nClinical impact:\nStatins may reduce SAH risk, especially in high-risk patients. While promising, causal conclusions require further study.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40625226/\n\n@HakimApps_Guideline",

Hospitalized adults (hemodynamically stable): A restrictive transfusion strategy is recommended, with transfusions considered when hemoglobin falls below 7 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). For patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a threshold of 7.5 g/dL may be used, and for orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease, 8 g/dL may be considered.\n\n2. Adults with hematologic or oncologic disorders: A restrictive transfusion strategy is suggested, with transfusions considered when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).\n\n3. Critically ill children: For hemodynamically stable children without conditions such as hemoglobinopathy, cyanotic cardiac conditions, or severe hypoxemia, a restrictive transfusion strategy is recommended, considering transfusion when hemoglobin is less than 7 g/dL (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).\n\n4. Children with congenital heart disease: Transfusion thresholds vary based on the heart abnormality and the stage of surgical repair:\n   - Biventricular repair: 7 g/dL\n   - Single-ventricle palliation: 9 g/dL\n   - Uncorrected congenital heart disease: 7 to 9 g/dL (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence).\n@HakimApps_Guideline\n\n#Articles #MedicalNews",

This study assessed its real-world impact.\n\nMethods:\nUsing VA and TriNetX databases (2009\u20132019), we identified >11,000 adults who survived a first SBP episode. Outcomes were compared between those who received SecSBPPr and those who did not.\n\nResults:\nSecSBPPr was prescribed in ~50% of cases. In both cohorts, it was linked to a significantly higher risk of SBP recurrence (HR 1.63\u20131.68; P<0.001) and, in the VA group, to increased fluoroquinolone resistance (OR 4.32; P=0.03). Recurrence risk worsened over time.\n\nConclusion:\nSecSBPPr was associated with increased SBP recurrence and resistance, suggesting the need to reconsider its routine use in cirrhosis.\n\nLink: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39235290/\n\n@HakimApps_Guideline",

Severe pneumonia. He needed oxygen, antibiotics, tests but the hospital had none. No oxygen. No meds. No lab support. She had no money. I had no choice.\n\nI ran through wards begging. Found one oxygen cylinder in surgery begged again. Dragged it down. Paid for his meds. Paid for his labs. Not because I can afford, but because I had no choice.\n\nHe lived. She wept. I cried not from exhaustion, but from despair. Because saving a child shouldn\u2019t demand such desperation.\n\nThe next day, no one asked. No one cared. Just another shift. Just another life nearly lost.\n\nAnd I still ask: Why must we beg to do our jobs?\n\nWe\u2019re not asking for luxury.

Secondary outcomes and adverse events were similar. Physicians rated iNCDSS highly for clarity, efficiency, and safety.\n\nClinical impact:\niNCDSS may be a reliable tool for inpatient insulin management, potentially improving workflow and maintaining glycemic safety.\n\nLink: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40332936/\n\n@HakimApps_Guideline",

    "text": "Senior Physicians: It\u2019s Time to Step Forward\nDr Muluken A. (Assistant Professor Pediatric Cardiologist)\n\nAs a senior physician, I\u2019ve seen how our healthcare system is under immense pressure. We are not exempt from the burden\u2014many of us struggle with inadequate salaries, delayed duty payments, lack of health insurance, and the soaring cost of living that makes it difficult to cover even basic expenses like rent and food. On top of that, emotional fatigue and professional burnout are becoming more common among us.\n\nYet despite all this, most of us remain silent. Some are afraid of administrative repercussions; others are worn down by years of unmet demands. A few manage to cushion the impact through private work and choose to stay quiet. Many of us work in teaching hospitals where the hierarchy is so rigid that interns and residents hesitate to raise concerns openly with us. I\u2019ve experienced this personally\u2014when I tried to bring these issues up, I was met with avoidance, not engagement.\n\nBut silence will not protect us, nor will it fix the system. We, as senior physicians, must speak out\u2014in staff meetings, academic circles, and professional associations. We should mentor through solidarity, encouraging younger colleagues to speak safely and openly. We must use our influence to push for real policy changes and show that leadership includes advocacy. If we don\u2019t take the lead in defending the dignity of our profession, who will?\n\n#SeniorDoctorsRise #ReclaimOurProfession #SpeakUpForHealthcare\n\nDr Muluken A.

The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including CV death, MI, and stroke. Safety outcomes included ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.\n\nResults:\nMMT use was associated with a significantly lower rate of MACE (16.4 vs. 24.1 per 1,000 person-years; HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52\u20130.90). There was no significant increase in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.60\u20131.44)..\n\nClinical impact:\nMMT may offer cardiovascular protection in bronchiectasis, beyond reducing exacerbations.\n\nLink: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39603670/\n\n@HakimApps_Guideline",

RAASi discontinuation was lower in SGLT2i users (36% vs. 45%; P<.001).\n\nClinical impact:\nThe findings suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors can mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia in patients receiving RAASi, potentially improving adherence to RAASi therapy and enhancing overall clinical outcomes for patients with diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease.\n\nLink: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40293730/\n\n@HakimApps_Guideline",
